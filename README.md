# Colorado River Mid-term Modeling System (CRMMS)
Introduction: The Colorado River Mid-term Modeling System (CRMMS) is a software model designed to simulate the behavior of the Colorado River over a 24-month study period. The model is intended to provide valuable insights for water resource managers and policymakers in effectively managing the Colorado River's water resources.

## Input Data: 
The CRMMS requires several input data to simulate the behavior of the Colorado River over the 24-month study period. The necessary input data includes historical flow data, upstream and downstream reservoir data, water demand data, and various policy parameters. Users should have the most recent and accurate data to achieve the most reliable results.

## Model Parameters: 
The model includes various parameters to define the river's behavior and the policies that govern its management. The parameters include the following:
- Evaporation rate.
- Inflow variability.
- Outflow variability.
- Downstream release policy.
- Upstream diversion policy.
- Water loss factor.
- Power production efficiency.

## Output Data: 
The CRMMS generates an output file containing data on the inflows, outflows, water levels of upstream and downstream reservoirs, total flow of the Colorado River, water demand, and power production for each month of the study period.

## Probabilistic Fan Charts: 
The CRMMS includes the ability to generate probabilistic fan charts for the next 12 months based on forecasted inflows. These fan charts visually represent the range of potential outcomes for the river's flow and water levels based on different scenarios. The number of scenarios and months to forecast are user-defined parameters.

## Usage: 
Users can run the CRMMS by providing the necessary input data and parameters. The model uses a series of calculations to determine the inflows, outflows, and water levels of upstream and downstream reservoirs, as well as the total flow of the Colorado River for each month of the study period. The output data can then be used to inform decision-making and policy development regarding the management of the Colorado River.

## Conclusion: 
Notice: It's a WIP so there is a lot of missing information as of now.

The Colorado River Mid-term Modeling System (CRMMS) is a tool for water resource managers and policymakers to simulate the behavior of the Colorado River over a 24-month study period.
